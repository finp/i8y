Everything is protected by a single RHSSO instance.

The RHSSO instance comes configured with the following realms:

* openshift - users who develop solutions using the Red Hat applications available from the Solution Explorer
* customer-applications - end users of the solutions developed by the users in the openshift realm (only in RHMI)

With RMMI, the `customer-admin` user has the `dedicated-admin` role.
In some Integreatly configurations, you have the `cluster-admin` role.
